# EDA-Project
Project on Analysis of AMCAT Data
This project is a comprehensive exploration of AMCAT (Aspiring Minds Computer Adaptive Test) data designed to extract actionable insights and drive informed decision-making. The analysis involves cleaning, processing, and visualizing large datasets collected from AMCAT assessments to identify trends in candidate performance, skill gaps, and employability metrics.
Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Implemented robust techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries to ensure high data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraged statistical methods and visualizations to uncover underlying patterns, such as candidate demographics, test score distributions, and correlations between skills and job roles.
Predictive Modeling: Developed machine learning models to predict candidate success and job fit, aiding organizations in efficient talent acquisition.
Interactive Dashboards: Created user-friendly dashboards to visualize trends and insights, enabling stakeholders to easily interpret the results.
Documentation & Reproducibility: Ensured that the project is well-documented with clear code structure and reproducible analysis steps to facilitate collaboration and further research.
